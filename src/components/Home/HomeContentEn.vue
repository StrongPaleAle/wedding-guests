        <h3>When?</h3>
        <p>
            Saturday the 18th of May 2024, from 17.00 onward. The ceremony will start at 17.30
            sharp!
        </p>
        <h3>What will happen?</h3>
        <p>
            We will have the ceremony in loco, and exchange our vows and rings in front of our
            closest friends and family, followed by the reception.
        </p>
        <p>
            The bridal couple would kindly ask if you could please refrain from using your phone for
            taking pictures and filming during the ceremony, however, feel free to use it during the
            reception!
        </p>
        <p>There will be music, good food, cake, an open bar and lots of fun!</p>
        <h3>Have you heard something about Thursday the 16th of May?</h3>
        <p>
            We could never get the hang of either Thursdays or bureaucracy, so we are signing our
            marriage license on Thursday the 16th of May! This will be at 5 pm at the Polo Culturale
            Artémisia, Via dell'Aeroporto, 10, 55012 Capannori LU, Italy. This is open to everyone,
            and you are welcome to attend if you wish.
        </p>
        <p>There won’t be any kind of ceremony, celebration or reception on the 16th of May.</p>
        <p>
            Joke aside, we had to separate the legal paperwork from the wedding itself as it was the
            most practical solution to overcome a few bureaucratic issues. As we are both fans of
            Douglas Adams and Thursdays had a key role in our relationship, we thought it would make
            sense that, since we have to separate the events, we may as well sort out our legal
            paperwork on a Thursday.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Big Day, with all the action, is on Saturday! We would love your presence at our
            ceremony and reception, which will be on the 18th of May.
        </p>
        <h3>Wedding List:</h3>
        <p class="subtitle">
            The greatest gift you can give to us, is your participation in our Big Day, on the 18th
            of May.
        </p>
        We don’t have a wedding list for 2 main reasons: First, we have been living together for 3
        years, and we already have most of the items usually part of a wedding list. Second, we live
        in the United Kingdom and have limited luggage space. Organising a wedding list that works
        both in the UK and Italy is incredibly complex.
        <p>
            If you wish to give us a gift, aside from your presence on our wedding day, you could
            donate to our honeymoon fund.
        </p>

        <p>
            We hope to travel to New Zealand in 2025, following Douglas Adams’ naturalistic
            footsteps in his documentary book “Last Chance to See”. (And yes, visit the sets of Lord
            of the Rings)
        </p>
        <h3>Dress Code:</h3>
        <p>
            The bride and groom's main colour scheme would be White and Teal. We would ask you to
            avoid wearing White, Teal or Black as the main colour/colours of your outfit.
        </p>
        <p>If you have doubts or questions, please contact the bride or groom.</p>
        <h3>RSVP:</h3>
        <p>
            We would be grateful if you RSVP, before the 30th of April to allow the bridal couple to
            organise the event.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can confirm your presence by <RouterLink to="/register">Signing Up</RouterLink> and
            acceding your <RouterLink to="/rsvp">RSVP page</RouterLink>, or contacting the bride or
            groom directly.
